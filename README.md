# Code-Quiz

### User Story

- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Issues identified and corrected

- Not showing an styling the score

I had some issues with my code where the input for the name and the score was not showing properly. What I needed to do was change some javascript CSS stlying from "hidden" to "block" which solved my issue

## Future work

- Update CSS styles to correctly see boxes
